# Beer-App
This is a mock e-comemrce app built with punk API. Users register the website and can buy beers they want.

[Live version](https://thebeerapp.herokuapp.com/)

## Technical Details
- In this app, a NoSQL database, MongoDB, is used. Some random beers from the Punk API is seeded to the database. The information about beers come from the database, not from the Punk API directly.
- For the backend, we used Node.js with Express framework.
- No framework is used for the front-end. Only a template engine (Handlebars), HTML, CSS and JavaScript are used.
- The master branch is the current branch.
